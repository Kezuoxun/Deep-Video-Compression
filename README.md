## TestDemo


## VP final project.pdf 
For our group's final project report, we explained the modifications we made to the original DVC program to optimize the image compression performance. 
We also organized the experimental results in the report.

In this project, my responsibilities were:
1.  Setting up the experimental environment using Anaconda.
2.  Proposing optimization methods and implementing them in the program.
